# Behavioral Robotics Project

This repository contains my work on Behavioral Robotics, a fascinating field that focuses on the development of robots that exhibit complex behaviors.

## Project Overview

The projects in this repository are inspired by the behaviors observed in nature, and they aim to replicate these behaviors in robotic systems. The goal is to create autonomous robots that can adapt to their environment and perform tasks with minimal human intervention.

## Key Features

1. **Bio-inspired Algorithms**: The robots use algorithms inspired by natural behaviors, such as flocking, foraging, and obstacle avoidance.
2. **Adaptive Learning**: The robots can learn from their environment and experiences, improving their performance over time.
3. **Multi-Robot Systems**: The projects explore the dynamics of multi-robot systems, with a focus on cooperation and coordination.

## Scenarios
The Project is mainly focused on three scenarios and 2 Programs, each one of the 2 scenarios will run in the Program as follows 

Scenario -1-
The Robot must Navigate through a Maze while the Obstacle avoids the walls using 2-Different behavioral tree Algorithms 

Scenario -2-
The Robot Must forsee 4 different colored balls which in our scenario are Red, Black, green, and blue, and write on the console the color of Each ball it finds in also 2 different behavioral tree Algorithms

Scenario -3-
This Scenario is the integration of the 2 previous scenarios as it will Navigate the maze, avoid obstacles, and finally see the balls and mention which ball it saw but also in a pre-programmed sequence as it must search for the balls in sequence according to the color of the ball which in our adaptation was Red, Blue, Green and finally Black 
with the integration of All these scenarios we had the results appealing but needed some fine-tuning for faster response.
## RESULTS
The results for this Program are showcased in the below videos as it is capable of navigating in a maze through behavioral Tree Classes using Python as follows:

## Applications

The potential applications of these projects are vast, ranging from search and rescue operations to environmental monitoring and space exploration.
